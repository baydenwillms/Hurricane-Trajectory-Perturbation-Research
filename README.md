# Uncertainties in Hurricane Trajectories derived from an Empirical Orthogonal Function Decomposition of Best Track Data
- Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), University of Miami, 2020-2021
- Under the guidance of Dr. Mohamed Iskandarani
- Programs written in Python
- Polynomial Chaos Framework Paper - The published research whose mathematical model is replicated in this project. The purpose of this research is to create a program which generates the results from pages 114-117 for any hurricane in the data set, instead of just the one that was being investigated in that paper. 



Python Files:
1. trackperturbations.py  - main program
2. trajectory_modified.py - support program for plotting results on a map
3. EBTsupport_edited.py - support program for reading in the data

Data:
1. Hurricane Data Format - the format of the data files
2. ebtrk_atlc_1988_2018.txt - Atlantic Ocean hurricane data
3. ebtrk_epac_2001_2018.txt - Pacific Ocean hurricane data

Sample Output for hurricane Sandy, 2012:
1. SANDY2012TrajectoryPerturbations - plots of the new trajectories (blue) and original trajectory (red)
2. SANDY2012VelocityPerturbations - the new calculated velocities used to find new trajectories

Report:
1. Final Research Report - the final report that I wrote documentating the details of the mathematics, THE OUTPUTS FOR OVER 15 HURRICANES, background information, code description, results, etc.
